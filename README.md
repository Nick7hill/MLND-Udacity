# MLND-Udacity
This Nanodegree is my gateway to the world of machine learning and Data Science.
It consists of a number of projects ,7 to be precise, covering differrent domains and testing differrent skills of machine learning as a whole

##Contents
[Titanic Exploration Project](https://github.com/Nick7hill/MLND-Udacity/blob/master/titanic-exploration/titanic-survival.ipynb)

[Boston housing prices](https://github.com/Nick7hill/MLND-Udacity/blob/master/boston-housing/boston_housing.ipynb)

[Finding Donors for Charity](https://github.com/Nick7hill/MLND-Udacity/blob/master/finding-donors/finding-donors.ipynb)

[image-classification](https://github.com/Nick7hill/MLND-Udacity/blob/master/image-classification/image_classification.ipynb)

[Capstone](https://github.com/Nick7hill/MLND-Udacity/blob/master/capstone/pima-indians-diabetes.ipynb)

##Requirements
The following tools and libraries were used in the project

__Anaconda 2.7 Jupter Notebook__

__Numpy__

__Pandas__

__Sklearn__

__matplotlib__

__tflearn__

__tensorflow__

__stacked_generalization__

##Details
The first project is an optional project on the famous titanic dataset, where we predict the no of survivors based on the different features presented to us.

The second project aims as predicting the house prices in boston 

The third project is a Supervised learning project for finding donors for charity

The fourth project is an unsupervised learnning project, where we differentiate customer segments and use PCA

The fifth project is a Reinforcement learning project on training a smartcab

The sixth project is a deep learning project on iamge-classification on the the CIFAR 10 dataset using tensorflow

The seventh project is a supervised learning capstone project on pima-indians-diabetes dataset.
